## Project Description

This project is a simple todo list web app. You can add new item to your todo list, remove items from the list and mark/un-mark items as done.

APIs are defined in AWS API Gateway (GET, POST, DELETE) and the front-end is on React.(this repo only has the front-end part and is calling APIs which are defined and working on AWS)

AWS stack is using API Gateway and Lambda functions (written on Node) for creating the APIs and DynamoDB to store the data.

Use `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
